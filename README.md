# Pong in Average4K

This is a simple pong game made in the game Average4K using the modcharting system. If Kade/anyone else wants me to private this github repo, i will do so.

Some code was referenced to my (old) love2d pong game, which is on my [Github](https://github.com/GuglioIsStupid/pong-love2d)

I will probably be doing more dumb stuff like this in the future, so stay tuned for that...
